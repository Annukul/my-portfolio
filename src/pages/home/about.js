                    I was born in the year 2000 and yes I donâ€™t have to calculate my age.
                    I developed an interest in web technologies when I was in my first year
                    of college (the year was the end of 2019). Since then I have been
                    learning and implementing what I have learned. To say exactly, I
                    have beek developing a lot of personal projects since then. And
                    now I have developed a sense of design. I love when the websites
                    I make look great. I focus more on the responsiveness of the website
                    because now they're a lot of traffic that comes from different devices,
                    some of them are big and some of them are small.<br />
                    <br />
                    I mostly do projects in the MERN stacks but I have a very good knowledge of PHP too.<br />
                    <br />
                    Apart from web dev, I love to travel, read books, and listen to good music. And
                    trust me I have very good taste in music. Music helps me to code faster and more
                    efficiently (just saying).<br />
